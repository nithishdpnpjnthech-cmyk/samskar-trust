Prompt:
Design and build a beautiful, modern, and emotional charity website for “Samsakar Trust”, a non-profit organization started by a celebrity.

The goal is to make it look professionally human-designed, not AI-generated. It should be responsive, clean, and full of warmth — using HTML, Tailwind CSS (or plain CSS), and a bit of JavaScript for animation and interactivity.

🔧 Tech Stack

HTML for structure

Tailwind CSS for layout, responsiveness, and style

JavaScript for animations, scroll effects, and donation interactivity

No React, no backend — only front-end

🎨 Design Style

Soft color palette: warm orange, deep green, and ivory white

Rounded buttons, large hero image, elegant typography

Use emotional real-human-style design, not robotic

Add subtle shadows, hover effects, and clean section spacing
